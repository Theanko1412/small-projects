## TwitchRewardAutoClicker 

Autoclicking program that clicks the reward button on twitch.tv for you.

When starting the program press number 1 if you want to use standard coordinates of the button(1080p resolution). If you want to put custom ones press 2.

### Custom coordinates
If you pressed option 2 into the terminal your are choosing custom coordinates. To make them put the cursor(Do not click) on top left side of the reward button and apply it with enter key, do the same thing with bottom right corner. If you do not have reward at the time of starting the program just wait a bit. (new reward is comming every 15ish minutes)
 
### Stoping the program
Program is stopped with holding the escape key(could take up to 30 seconds because of the sleep function to reduce system usage (can be stopped with 'x' button too)

To install and start using it you can dowload the zip folder, unpack it and find the .exe file.  --author Danko ÄŒurlin
